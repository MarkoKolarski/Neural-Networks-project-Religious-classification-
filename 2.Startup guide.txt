We recommend running it directly on Google Colab.

1) If you choose this method, you need to upload the 'mitnop datasets' folder to Google Drive (in the main directory 'My Drive') and run the code. A window will pop up where you need to allow access to Drive.

2) Otherwise, place the 'mitnop datasets' folder wherever you prefer and manually set each path to it. Create a block for each comment: # IN15/2021 Ilija Vitošević, # IN60/2021 Marko Kolarski, # IN47/2021 Srđan Garić IMG, and # IN47/2021 Srđan Garić CSV. Run the .py/.ipynb file (not recommended, as we worked on Google Colab, so the paths and blocks are set for it).
